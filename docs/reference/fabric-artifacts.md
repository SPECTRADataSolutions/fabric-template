# Microsoft Fabric Artifacts

This repository contains Microsoft Fabric workspace artifacts that are **valid and required** by the Fabric platform.

## Valid Fabric Artifacts

The following folder/file patterns are **expected and valid** for Microsoft Fabric workspaces:

- `*.Lakehouse/` - Fabric Lakehouse artifacts
- `*.Notebook/` - Fabric Notebook artifacts
- `*.Environment/` - Fabric Environment artifacts
- `*.DataPipeline/` - Fabric Data Pipeline artifacts
- `*.VariableLibrary/` - Fabric Variable Library artifacts
- `*-source/` - SPECTRA methodology stage folders (1-source, 2-prepare, etc.)

## Why These Exist

These artifacts are created and managed by Microsoft Fabric when:
- Creating a new Lakehouse
- Creating a new Notebook
- Setting up an Environment
- Creating a Data Pipeline
- Configuring Variable Libraries

## Structure Compliance

These artifacts **do not violate** SPECTRA folder structure standards because:
1. They are required by the Microsoft Fabric platform
2. They are automatically generated by Fabric
3. They follow Fabric's naming conventions
4. They are part of the workspace structure, not application code

## Ignoring in Audits

The structure audit script should recognize these as valid Fabric artifacts and not flag them as violations.
