    severity: critical

    status: broken
    reason: 'BLOCKER-002: Folder API rejects valid payloads (HTTP 400)'
    workaround: Manual creation required
    severity: critical
  requirement:

implementation_notes:
  working_sequence:
  - 1. project (manual creation in UI)
  - 2. release (API works, but locks >60s - use existing releases)
  - 3. requirement_folder (API works perfectly)
  - '4. requirement (use workaround: /requirementtree/add with parentId)'
  - 5. cycle (API works with unlocked release)
  blocked_sequence:
  - 6. testcase_folder (BROKEN - blocks all downstream)
  - 7. testcase (blocked by folder)
  - 8. allocation (blocked by testcase)
  - 9. execution (blocked by testcase)
  critical_path: testcase_folder must be fixed to unblock testcase → execution/allocation
recommended_approach:
  phase_1_working:
    entities: *id001
    status: ✅ Can automate now
    notes: Use existing releases, requirement workaround
  phase_2_blocked:
    entities:
    - testcase_folder
    - testcase
    - allocation
    - execution
    status: ❌ Requires API fix or manual creation
    notes: Testcase folder API must be fixed by Zephyr
