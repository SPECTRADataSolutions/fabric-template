    title: Requirement Creation API Broken
    severity: critical
    entity: requirement
    endpoint: POST /requirement
    issue: 'Returns HTTP 500: ''Cannot invoke java.lang.Long.longValue() because id
      is null'''
    impact: Cannot create requirements via documented API
    workaround:
      method: Use POST /requirementtree/add with parentId
      status: ✅ Working
      notes: Must create requirement_folder first, then use parentId

    title: Testcase Folder API Broken
    severity: critical
    entity: testcase_folder
    endpoint: POST /testcasetree
    issue: 'Returns HTTP 400: ''For input string: null'''
    impact: Cannot create testcase folders, blocks all testcase/execution/allocation
      creation
    workaround:
      method: Manual creation in UI required
      status: ⚠️ Manual only
      notes: 'Tried 4 variations (omit parentId, parentId: null, parentId: 0, no parentId
        field) - all failed'

    title: Release Lock Duration >60 Seconds
    severity: high
    entity: release
    endpoint: POST /release
    issue: Newly created releases are locked for >60 seconds, preventing cycle creation
    impact: Cannot create cycles immediately after release creation
    workaround:
      method: Use existing (old) releases for cycle creation
      status: ✅ Working
      notes: Tested 15s, 30s, 60s delays - all failed. Old releases work immediately.

  bugs:
  - id: BUG-007
    title: Release GET by ID Returns HTTP 403
    severity: medium
    entity: release
    endpoint: GET /release/{id}
    issue: Returns HTTP 403 Forbidden even with valid API token
    impact: Cannot validate release creation via GET
    workaround:
      method: Skip GET validation for releases
      status: ✅ Working
      notes: Assume creation succeeded if POST returns 200/201
    reported_to_vendor: false

  quirks:
  - id: QUIRK-001
    title: Requirement Names Must Be Unique Across All Runs
    severity: low
    entity: requirement
    issue: API rejects duplicate requirement names even across different test runs
    impact: Must use timestamps or UUIDs in requirement names
    workaround:
      method: Include timestamp in requirement name
      status: ✅ Working
      notes: Use datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S') in name
    date_discovered: '2025-12-08'
  - id: QUIRK-002
    title: Cycle Creation Requires Unlocked Release
    severity: medium
    entity: cycle
    issue: Cannot create cycle with newly created release (locked)
    impact: Must use existing releases or wait >60s
    workaround:
      method: Query for existing releases and use oldest one
      status: ✅ Working
      notes: Oldest releases are most likely unlocked
    date_discovered: '2025-12-08'
  - id: QUIRK-003
    title: Testcase Requires tcrCatalogTreeId (Folder ID)
    severity: medium
    entity: testcase
    issue: Cannot create testcase without tcrCatalogTreeId
    impact: Blocked by BLOCKER-002 (folder creation broken)
    workaround:
      method: None - depends on folder API fix
      status: ❌ Blocked
      notes: Must fix folder API first
    date_discovered: '2025-12-08'
  api_inconsistencies:
  - id: INCONSISTENCY-001
    title: Requirement Creation Uses Folder Endpoint
    entity: requirement
    issue: POST /requirement is broken, must use POST /requirementtree/add
    notes: Folder and requirement creation use same endpoint, differentiated by parentId
      presence
  - id: INCONSISTENCY-002
    title: Date Format Inconsistency
    entity: multiple
    issue: Some endpoints accept 'YYYY-MM-DD', others require epoch milliseconds
    examples:
      release: Accepts 'YYYY-MM-DD' string
      cycle: Requires epoch milliseconds (int)
    notes: No consistent date format across API
  undocumented_behavior:
  - id: UNDOCUMENTED-001
    title: Release Lock Mechanism
    entity: release
    behavior: Releases are locked after creation for >60 seconds
    notes: Not mentioned in API documentation
  - id: UNDOCUMENTED-002
    title: Folder API parentId Rejection
    entity: testcase_folder
    behavior: 'API rejects parentId: null despite documentation suggesting it''s valid
      for root folders'
    notes: Documentation doesn't clarify how to create root folders
